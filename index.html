          I have been a Fomule 1 fan for a few years now. Later on, I would like
          to work in this field, especially in the sponsoring industry.

          I obtained my international baccalaureate in the Italian section. Then
          I did my 3 years of studies at Skema BS. Now I'm doing my master in
          Marketing at Kedge BS.

          KEDGE Business School is a French private business school of general
          interest. It was created in 2013 from the merger of two schools: BEM
          (formerly ESC Bordeaux) and Euromed Management (formerly ESC
          Marseille).
        </p>
        <p>
          KEDGE welcomes its students on 11 campuses with a rich and lively
          student life. 7 are based in France: Kedge Paris, Kedge Bordeaux,
          Kedge Marseille, Kedge Toulon, but also 3 associated campuses
          (Avignon, Bastia, Bayonne). 4 campuses are located abroad: 2 in China
          (Shanghai and Suzhou), 1 in Senegal (Dakar) and 1 in CÃ´te d'Ivoire
          (Abidjan).
        </p>
        <p>
          The business school offers initial and continuing education from Bac+2
          to Bac+6, particularly in management. 4 generalist programmes stand
          out: the Grande Ecole Programme, the KEDGE Bachelor, the International
          BBA and the EBP International. These programmes are ideal for students
          wishing to acquire a complete management education.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are also specialised programmes, most of which lead to a
          Master's degree. Students can take masters in management in the fields
          of finance, quality, real estate, human resources, international trade
          or supply chain. Work-study programmes are also available in these
          fields.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every year, KEDGE Business School is well positioned in the rankings
          of the major business schools, for the quality of the studies it
          offers.
